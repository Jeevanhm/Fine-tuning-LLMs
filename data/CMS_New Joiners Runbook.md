1. ABOUT CLIENT

Founded in 1852, The Mount Sinai Hospital is a 1,134-bed, tertiary-care teaching facility acclaimed internationally for excellence in clinical care.

In the U.S. News & World Report 2021-22 "Best Hospitals" rankings, Mount Sinai Hospital is designated with highest recognition and our institution is nationally ranked in 11 specialties including Geriatrics, Cardiology/Heart Surgery, Diabetes/Endocrinology, Neurology/Neurosurgery, Orthopedics, Gastroenterology & GI Surgery, Rehabilitation, Urology, Pulmonology & Lung Surgery, Ear, Nose and Throat, and Cancer. Our pediatric center, Mount Sinai Kravis Children’s Hospital is also recognized on U.S. News & World Report's 2021-22 Best Children's Hospitals rankings.

Mount Sinai Health System is New York City's largest academic medical system, encompassing eight hospitals, a leading medical school, and a network of ambulatory practices. Mount Sinai is an international source of unrivalled education, translational research and discovery, and clinical delivery outcomes.

Mount Sinai is among the top research and clinical institutions providing response to COVID-19, leveraging numerous artificial intelligence algorithms and machine learning models developed in-house.  The current pandemic has accelerated the need and urgency for speed and innovation, including rapid access to data and collaboration. However, Mount Sinai is constrained by a legacy technology environment that is costly to maintain, and in some instances, with components beyond end of life. The culmination of technical debt has created an environment that is costly to maintain and prohibitive to research advancement and clinical outcomes.

Given the demands placed on the clinical and research teams; there exists an enterprise imperative to enable a landscape of technology services that are up to date, always available, inexpensive to implement / maintain, and readily available on a self-service basis.

1. ABOUT ACCENTURE

Accenture is a global management consulting, technology services and outsourcing company. Combining unparalleled experience, comprehensive capabilities across all industries and business functions, and extensive research on the world's most successful companies, Accenture collaborates with Mount Sinai to help them become high-performance businesses and governments.
